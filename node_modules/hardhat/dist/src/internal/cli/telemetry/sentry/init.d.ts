 * This function initializes a custom global sentry reporter/client.
 *
 * There are two reasons why we customize it, instead of using the default one
 * provided by @sentry/node:
 *   - @sentry/node has an astronomical amount of dependencies -- See https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/discussions/13846
 *   - We customize the transport to avoid blocking the main Hardhat process
 *     while reporting errors.
 *
 * Once you initialize the custom global sentry reporter, you can use the usual
 * `captureException` and `captureMessage` functions exposed by @sentry/core.
 *
 * The reason that this uses the global instance of sentry (by calling
 * initAndBind), is that using the client directly doesn't work with the linked
 * errors integration.
 *
 * Calling `init` also has an option to set global unhandled rejection and
 * uncaught exception handlers.
