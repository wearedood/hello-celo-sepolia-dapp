/**
 * A compiler downloader which must be specialized per-platform. It can't and
 * shouldn't support multiple platforms at the same time.
 *
 * This is expected to be used like this:
 *    1. First, the downloader is created for the given platform.
 *    2. Then, call `downloader.updateCompilerListIfNeeded(versionsToUse)` to
 *       update the compiler list if one of the versions is not found.
 *    3. Then, call `downloader.isCompilerDownloaded()` to check if the
 *       compiler is already downloaded.
 *    4. If the compiler is not downloaded, call
 *       `downloader.downloadCompiler()` to download it.
 *    5. Finally, call `downloader.getCompiler()` to get the compiler.
 *
 * Important things to note:
 *   1. If a compiler version is not found, this downloader may fail.
 *      1.1.1 If a user tries to download a new compiler before X amount of time
 *      has passed since its release, they may need to clean the cache, as
 *      indicated in the error messages.
